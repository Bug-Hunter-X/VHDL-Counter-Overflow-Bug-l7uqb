# VHDL Counter Overflow Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in VHDL code: incorrect handling of counter overflow.

The `bug.vhdl` file contains a VHDL counter that does not correctly handle the case where it reaches the maximum value (10). This can lead to unexpected behavior or simulation failures.

The `bugSolution.vhdl` file provides a corrected version of the code that handles the overflow correctly.
